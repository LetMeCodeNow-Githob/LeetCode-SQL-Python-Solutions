# **LeetCode SQL & Python Solutions ðŸš€**  

ðŸ’¡ *"Solving puzzles, one query at a time."*  

Welcome to my **LeetCode SQL & Python** journey! This repository is where I tackle **real-world data challenges** disguised as coding problems. 
Whether it's **optimizing SQL queries**, mastering **window functions**, or making Python work its magic, every problem is an opportunity to level up.  

## **ðŸ“Œ What You'll Find Here:**  
âœ… **SQL Solutions** â€“ Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions, CTEs, and more!  
âœ… **Python Solutions** â€“ Data manipulation, algorithms, and efficient scripting.  
âœ… **Problem-Solving Insights** â€“ Not just answers, but explanations on why they work.  

## **ðŸŒ± Why Iâ€™m Doing This?**  

I love problem-solvingâ€” itâ€™s like a self-inflicted brain workout. 
It keeps my mind sharp, while writing cleaner and more efficient code... and occasionally torturing myself in the process!


## **ðŸš€ Letâ€™s Connect!**  
If you're also on a **LeetCode grind**, feel free to connect! Iâ€™m always up for discussing SQL, Python and best practices.
