# **LeetCode SQL & Python Solutions ðŸš€**  

ðŸ’¡ *"Solving puzzles, one query at a time."*  

Welcome to my **LeetCode SQL & Python** journey! This repository is where I tackle **real-world data challenges** disguised as coding problems. 
Every solution here is part of a journeyâ€”sometimes messy, sometimes elegant, but always a step forward in becoming better at problem-solving. There's no pretense of knowing everything, but the excitement comes from the learning process and the constant effort to improve.

If you're new to coding, welcome! This is all about experimenting, figuring things out, and growing through trial and error. Whether you're looking for new ways to think about problems or simply want to see how someone else approached them, this is a place to be. ðŸŒ±
Learning never stops. This is a journey, and every step forward is worth celebrating.

## **ðŸ“Œ What You'll Find Here:**  
âœ… **SQL Solutions** â€“ Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions, CTEs, and more!  
âœ… **Python Solutions** â€“ Data manipulation, algorithms, and efficient scripting.  
âœ… **Problem-Solving Insights** â€“ Not just answers, but explanations on why they work.  

## **ðŸŒ± Why Iâ€™m Doing This?**  

I love problem-solvingâ€” itâ€™s like a self-inflicted brain workout. 
It keeps my mind sharp, while writing cleaner and more efficient code... and occasionally torturing myself in the process!


## **ðŸš€ Letâ€™s Connect!**  
If you're also on a **LeetCode grind**, feel free to connect! Iâ€™m always up for discussing SQL, Python and best practices.
